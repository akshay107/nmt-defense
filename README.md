This repository contains code for the paper:

* Ignorance is Bliss: Exploring Defenses Against Invariance-based Attacks on Neural Machine Translation Systems. IEEE TAI, 2021 [[pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9612034)]

This code is for two contrasting defense strategies against invariance-based attack for NMT systems. The two defenese strategies, namely, Learn to Deal (LTD) and Learn to Ignore (LTI), perform noise-aware training on NMT systems.
